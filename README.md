## Food Nutrition Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository documents an "end-to-end Data Science project" focused on understanding food nutrition data through a structured and transparent workflow. The goal of this project is to strengthen my data science skills by working on a real-world dataset — from "data exploration to insight generation and modeling" — while sharing the learning process openly.

This project is also part of my "learning-in-public" journey, where anyone interested can explore the notebooks and learn alongside me.

## Objectives

* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on real-world nutrition data
* Understand data structure, quality, and limitations
* Identify meaningful health-related signals from nutritional features
* Build a strong foundation for future feature engineering and modeling
* Practice professional, reproducible data science workflows using GitHub

## Dataset

* Source: OpenFoodFacts (cleaned subset)
* Type: Food nutrition data
* Features include:

  * Energy (kcal)
  * Sugar, fat, saturated fat
  * Fiber, protein, salt
  * Nutrition score (Nutri-Score)
  * Processing level (NOVA group)

The dataset is already partially cleaned, allowing the project to focus on analysis, interpretation, and decision-making, which closely reflects real-world industry workflows.

##  Current Progress

### Stage 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (Completed)

* Data ingestion and validation
* Dataset structure and feature inspection
* Data quality and missing-value analysis
* Statistical exploration of key nutritional variables
* Initial insight discovery (e.g., extreme sugar values)

## Next Steps

* Insight-driven EDA (e.g., sugar vs fiber analysis)
* Processing-level (NOVA) based comparisons
* Feature engineering and health scoring logic
* Basic machine learning models
* Clear documentation of findings and decisions

## Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas
* GitHub Codespaces
* Jupyter Notebooks

## Learn Along

This repository is public and open. Feel free to:

* Explore the notebooks
* Follow the project’s progression
* Learn along as the analysis evolves

Feedback and discussions are always welcome.


This project emphasizes clarity, transparency, and strong analytical thinking over quick results or black-box models.
